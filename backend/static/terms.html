    <li>If you select a primary Hero and mention our Instagram or TikTok account in your posts, we analyze the content to determine XP eligibility. Results are applied to your Hero on-chain.</li>
    <li>We do not store full media content of user posts; however, we keep a hash for duplicate-checking, which may be periodically deleted.</li>
    <li>Once XP has been awarded on-chain, it cannot be reversed or removed by us.</li>
